        question: 'What is MTN QuantRisk Intelligence Platform?',
        answer: 'MTN QuantRisk is an AI-powered quantitative risk dashboard built specifically for MTN Ghana. It combines real financial data, calibrated stress scenarios, machine learning forecasts, and stochastic simulation to give the risk and finance team a single unified view of MTN\'s exposure to macro, regulatory, operational, and competitive risks.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Who is this platform designed for?',
        answer: 'The platform serves three main audiences: the Risk & Finance team (daily monitoring and scenario analysis), senior management (scenario briefings and forward projections), and board members (executive summary briefs and key risk narratives). The interface is designed so non-technical users can interpret results without statistical training.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How often is the data updated?',
        answer: 'News is scraped when the backend starts and every 15 minutes afterward. Base-case KPI values change when an authorised user uploads new CSV or PDF data. Forecasts use the latest loaded base case. Ghana Macro observations come from the World Bank, are cached for six hours, and are generally updated annually by the source.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Is the data real or simulated?',
        answer: 'The structural data (KPI definitions, thresholds, scenario library) is based on MTN Ghana\'s actual financial framework. The base-case KPI values are calibrated to FY2025 estimates. Monte Carlo and forecast outputs are computed by models — they are projections, not guaranteed outcomes.',

        question: 'How do I navigate between modules?',
        answer: 'Use the left sidebar.

        question: 'What is the difference between a KPI and a KRI?',
        answer: 'A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) measures current or past business performance — e.g., "Service Revenue was GHS 24,400M in FY25." A KRI (Key Risk Indicator) is a forward-looking signal that warns of rising risk before it becomes a performance problem — e.g., "Cedi/USD above 13.0 is a warning that revenue in USD terms is deteriorating."',
      },
      {
        question: 'What does the Warning or Critical status mean?',
        answer: 'Each KPI has two thresholds set by the risk team. Warning means the KPI has crossed the first boundary — elevated risk, heightened monitoring required. Critical means the second boundary has been breached — immediate escalation, executive notification, and potentially a risk committee response. For External KPIs (Inflation, Policy Rate, Cedi/USD), the logic is inverted: higher values are worse.',
        example: 'FIN03 EBITDA Margin: Warning below 58%, Critical below 55%. EXT01 Inflation: Warning above 15%, Critical above 25%.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the "base case"?',
        answer: 'The base case is the set of current FY2025 reference values for all 14 KPIs, loaded from data/structured/base_case.csv. It represents the "starting point" before any stress is applied. Every stressed KPI output in the platform is expressed as a deviation from this baseline.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What are the 14 tracked KPIs?',
        answer: 'Financial: FIN01 Service Revenue (GHSm), FIN02 EBITDA (GHSm), FIN03 EBITDA Margin (%), FIN04 PAT (GHSm), FIN05 PAT Margin (%), FIN06 Revenue Growth YoY (%). Segment: SEG01 Data Revenue (GHSm), SEG03 MoMo Revenue (GHSm). Operational: OPS01 Total Subscribers (M), OPS04 ARPU (GHS), OPS07 4G Coverage (%). External: EXT01 Inflation (%), EXT02 BoG Policy Rate (%), EXT03 Cedi/USD.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why do some KPIs show "Watch" and others show "Safe" even during the same stress scenario?',
        answer: 'Different KPIs have different sensitivities to different scenarios. For example, a Cedi Devaluation scenario strongly impacts FIN01 (Service Revenue in USD terms) and OPS04 (ARPU), but has minimal direct effect on OPS07 (4G Coverage). The Stress Tester shows you the exact impact on every KPI simultaneously so you can see which are most exposed.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I update the base-case KPI values?',
        answer: 'Go to Settings → Upload Zone. Upload a CSV with at minimum two columns: KPI_ID and FY25_Base_Value. Accepted KPI IDs are FIN01–FIN06, SEG01, SEG03, OPS01, OPS04, OPS07, EXT01, EXT02, EXT03. After upload, all caches are cleared and the new values take effect immediately.',

    items: [
      {
        question: 'What is a stress scenario?',
        answer: 'A stress scenario describes a specific adverse event — such as a 25% Cedi devaluation, a 1.5% MoMo e-levy increase, or a major cyber breach — with calibrated impact values for each affected KPI. The scenario engine applies these impacts to the base case to compute what MTN\'s financials would look like under that event.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What does the Severity Multiplier do exactly?',
        answer: 'It scales every KPI impact value in the scenario by the chosen multiplier. A 15% revenue impact at 1.0× becomes a 30% impact at 2.0×. Use it to explore how the risk changes as the event becomes more or less severe than its historical calibration.',
        example: 'S01 Cedi Devaluation at 1.0× models a 25% devaluation. At 2.0×, it models a 50% devaluation — closer to the 2022 crisis level.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What are the risk Pillars?',
        answer: 'Pillars classify scenarios by the type of risk driver. A = Macro & FX (exchange rate, inflation, policy rate), B = Regulatory (NCA penalties, e-levy, spectrum policy), C = Tech & Cyber (outages, data breaches, infrastructure failure), D = Competitive (subscriber loss, price war), E = Operational & Climate (natural disaster, supply chain), F = Upside (growth opportunities), G = Tail Risk (combined catastrophic events).',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between Stress, Shock, Combined, and Upside scenario types?',
        answer: '"Stress" scenarios model slow-building adverse trends (e.g., 12-month inflationary pressure). "Shock" scenarios model sudden, sharp events (e.g., an overnight 20% Cedi move). "Combined" scenarios stack multiple risk factors simultaneously. "Upside" scenarios model positive surprises — useful for capital allocation and opportunity planning.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is a calibration anchor?',
        answer: 'The historical event or empirical study used to set the scenario\'s impact values. For example, the Cedi Devaluation scenario is calibrated against the 2022 Cedi crisis, where a 55% devaluation was observed. The calibration anchor gives the scenario statistical credibility.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What are Macro Overlays?',
        answer: 'Macro Overlays let you compound additional macroeconomic shocks on top of an existing scenario. The three overlays are: Cedi Shock Pct (additional % devaluation), Inflation Overlay (additional percentage points of inflation), and Policy Rate Overlay (additional pp rise in BoG rate). These interact multiplicatively with the scenario\'s base impacts.',
        example: 'Running a Cyber Breach scenario (Pillar C) + 20% Cedi Overlay models the realistic risk that a security incident triggers investor flight and FX depreciation simultaneously.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I create a new scenario?',
        answer: 'On the Stress Tester page, click "New Scenario" to open the Scenario Form Modal. Fill in the name, pillar, type, severity, plausibility, description, and add KPI impacts with their type (pct/delta/abs) and value. The new scenario is saved to the scenario library immediately.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What does SHAP show in the waterfall chart?',
        answer: 'The SHAP waterfall breaks down the KPI\'s movement from base to stressed value into individual contributor bars. Each bar represents one business driver — for example, "Inflation_YoY_Pct contributed −2.3% to EBITDA Margin." Positive bars push the KPI up; negative bars push it down. The total equals the overall KPI change.',

    iconName: 'Dices',
    items: [
      {
        question: 'Why use Monte Carlo instead of the regular Stress Tester?',
        answer: 'The Stress Tester gives you a single deterministic outcome: "Under this scenario, Service Revenue falls 8.3%." Monte Carlo gives you a distribution: "In the worst 5% of possible outcomes, it falls more than 12%. In the best 5%, it actually rises 3%." The distribution tells you how confident you should be in any single estimate.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the uncertainty band?',
        answer: 'It controls the Gaussian noise added to each impact value per simulation. At ±10%, each impact is sampled from a normal distribution with standard deviation equal to 10% of the impact value. A wider band reflects more uncertainty in the scenario calibration itself — e.g., if you are not confident that the Cedi impact is exactly −15% and could be anywhere from −5% to −25%, set a wide band.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How should I choose how many simulations to run?',
        answer: '200 simulations: fast, good for quick exploration and directional insight. 500: reasonable accuracy for most decisions. 1,000: recommended for reporting and board presentations. 2,000: smoothest distributions, lowest statistical noise — use for final risk quantification reports.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What does P05 mean for planning purposes?',
        answer: 'P05 is your "stress floor" — the value that only 5% of simulated outcomes fall below. For capital planning, it answers the question: "What is the worst we should prudently plan for?" A P05 below a KPI\'s Critical threshold indicates that under this scenario, severe outcomes are statistically plausible and warrant capital buffer allocation.',
        example: 'If FIN03 EBITDA Margin has a P05 of 55.2% and its Critical threshold is 55%, the scenario has a ~5% simulated probability of breaching Critical status.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What does "Most Exposed KPI" mean in the summary?',
        answer: 'After running the simulation, the platform ranks all 14 KPIs by their P05 percentage deviation from base. The "Most Exposed" KPI is the one with the largest adverse P05 deviation — meaning it is most sensitive to this scenario under stochastic conditions. This is your top priority risk under the given stress event.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I reproduce the same simulation results?',
        answer: 'Monte Carlo uses a random number generator. Without a fixed seed, each run produces slightly different results. For reproducibility in formal risk reports, contact the development team to enable seed-based runs via the API (/api/monte-carlo with a seed parameter).',

    iconName: 'LineChart',
    items: [
      {
        question: 'How are the forecasts generated?',
        answer: 'FIN01 (Service Revenue) uses a trained ARIMA model fitted on quarterly historical data. The model captures revenue trend and momentum to project 90 days forward. All other KPIs currently use a calibrated random-walk model (which adds realistic drift and volatility around the base value) until additional model training data is available.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How accurate are the 90-day forecasts?',
        answer: 'The ARIMA model for FIN01 is evaluated using Leave-One-Out cross-validation — the published MAE and R² in Settings reflect true out-of-sample accuracy. For the random-walk models, treat the output as an uncertainty range rather than a precise prediction. Forecast accuracy degrades beyond 30 days for all KPIs.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why is the confidence band very wide?',
        answer: 'A wide band is statistically honest — it reflects genuine uncertainty in the outlook. Factors like upcoming elections, commodity price moves, or NCA decisions are not observable in the model inputs but would significantly affect the actual outcome. The band says "we are 90% confident the true value will fall within this range."',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I see forecasts for all 14 KPIs?',
        answer: 'Yes — use the KPI selector dropdown on the Forecasts page to switch between any of the 14 tracked KPIs. Note that non-FIN01 KPIs use the random-walk model until XGBoost-based forecast models are trained on additional historical quarterly data.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How does the forecast differ from the Stress Tester output?',
        answer: 'The forecast models the unconditional future trajectory based on historical patterns — "what happens if current trends continue." The Stress Tester models a conditional scenario — "what happens if this specific event occurs." Use forecasts for baseline planning, Stress Tester for event-driven risk assessment.',

    items: [
      {
        question: 'What is reverse stress testing and why does it matter?',
        answer: 'Reverse stress testing is a regulatory best practice (required under Basel frameworks and increasingly under African central bank guidelines). Instead of asking "what happens if this scenario occurs?", it asks "what scenario would break us?" It forces identification of vulnerabilities that traditional forward-looking stress tests might miss.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the binary search trajectory?',
        answer: 'When you run a single-scenario reverse stress test, the engine finds the minimum severity multiplier that breaches your target using binary search. It starts at 1.0×, tests if the KPI breaches, then adjusts up or down iteratively until it converges on the exact multiplier — typically within 10–15 iterations. The trajectory chart shows each step.',
        example: 'Finding that it takes 2.3× severity to push EBITDA Margin below 58% tells you the scenario has a safety margin of 1.3× before reaching Warning — a quantified buffer.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What does the Cross-Scenario Sweep tell me?',
        answer: 'It runs the binary search across every scenario in the library against your chosen failure target, and ranks them from most dangerous (lowest multiplier needed) to least dangerous. The scenario at the top of the list is your most proximate risk — the one that could breach your threshold with the least severity amplification.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What if no scenario can reach the target threshold?',
        answer: 'If all scenarios require a severity multiplier above 5× to breach your target, it means your chosen KPI is resilient to the current scenario library under that threshold. Consider: (1) lowering the threshold, (2) looking at Combined-type scenarios, or (3) flagging the target as a robustly defended position in your risk report.',

      },
      {
        question: 'Why does a manual scrape say 0 new articles?',
        answer: 'The number counts newly stored URLs, not all fetched feed entries. Zero is normal when every fetched URL is already in the database.

      {
        question: 'What is the difference between published time and scraped time?',

        question: 'Why does the dashboard show PPG Debt Service instead of public debt to GDP?',
