# MTN QuantRisk Intelligence Platform: Dashboard Audit & Architecture Review

## Executive Summary
This document provides an audit of the architectural decision to rebuild the MTN QuantRisk Dashboard natively using Next.js (App Router), React, and Tailwind CSS, rather than attempting to extend the existing `MTN-Ghana-KRI-Dashboard.html` monolithic file.

The transition from a single-file HTML/JS approach to a modern, component-driven React architecture was driven by several critical factors: scalability, maintainability, performance, and type safety.

## 1. Limitations of the Single-File HTML Architecture
The initial `MTN-Ghana-KRI-Dashboard.html` served as a functional prototype but presented significant structural bottlenecks for a production-grade enterprise application:

* **Lack of Scalability:** A monolithic HTML file cannot elegantly support 10 distinct views, 56 scenarios, and complex interactive components (e.g., Reverse Stress Testing, Cross-Scenario Sweeps) without becoming unmanageable.
* **Absence of Component Reusability:** UI elements, structural layouts, and interactive charts had to be duplicated or manually managed via vanilla JS DOM manipulation, leading to redundant code and visual inconsistencies.
* **State Management Complexity:** Managing complex state (e.g., selected scenarios, macro overlays, API data) across multiple interconnected views is notoriously brittle in vanilla JavaScript.
* **No Type Safety:** The absence of TypeScript meant that data contracts (KPIs, Scenarios, Stress Results) were implicit, increasing the likelihood of runtime errors.

## 2. Benefits of the Next.js (App Router) Architecture
By migrating to the React-based Next.js ecosystem, we unlocked several enterprise-grade capabilities:

### A. Modular Component Design
The UI is now broken down into small, reusable, and testable components (e.g., `WaterfallChart`, `SeveritySlider`, `PillarBadge`). This modularity ensures that the `DESIGN.md` system is applied consistently and that updates to a component instantly reflect across the entire platform.

### B. Robust State Management
We introduced a centralized application state (`useAppState`) using React Context/Reducers. This allows seamless synchronization between views—for instance, selecting a scenario in the main list instantly hydrates the comparison engine, the single-scenario solver, and the cross-scenario sweep.

### C. Strict Type Safety (TypeScript)
The entire codebase now enforces strict type contracts (`lib/types.ts`). This guarantees that API responses (mocked or real) perfectly match the shapes expected by UI components. Type safety eliminates entire categories of runtime exceptions, ensuring enterprise reliability.

### D. Modern Tooling and DX
* **Tailwind CSS v4:** Allowed us to rapidly implement the `DESIGN.md` token system (`theme.ts`) without wrestling with global CSS conflicts.
* **App Router:** Enabled clean, logical separation of routes (`/dashboard`, `/compare`, `/reverse`, `/scenarios`) with built-in nested layouts, preserving navigation state.
* **Linting & Compilation:** The codebase is now fortified with ESLint and strict TypeScript compilation, ensuring a high quality bar before deployment.

## 3. Final Hardening Pass
The final audit and hardening pass focused on:
1. **Resolving Type Conflicts:** Ensuring Chart.js data structures, API mocked endpoints, and React component props were perfectly aligned with the domain models.
2. **Deduplication:** Consolidating repeated logic into utility functions and shared UI elements.
3. **Design System Enforcement:** Ensuring no ad-hoc hex codes were used, strictly binding the UI to the tokens defined in `lib/theme.ts` (mapped directly from `DESIGN.md`).

## Conclusion
Rebuilding the dashboard was an essential architectural investment. The MTN QuantRisk Intelligence Platform is now a robust, scalable, and maintainable application ready and capable of supporting future advanced modeling capabilities.
